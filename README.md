# NumPy – Phase 1

This repository contains the foundational exercises and notes from my initial phase of learning NumPy, a core library for numerical computing in Python. The content was developed and practiced in Google Colab and includes hands-on examples to understand arrays, basic operations, and data manipulation.

## Topics Covered

- Importing and initializing NumPy
- Understanding the difference between Python lists and NumPy arrays
- Creating arrays using:
  - `np.array()`
  - `np.arange()`
  - `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, `np.full()`
  - `np.random.random()`
- Array properties:
  - Shape, dimensions, size, data type
- Array reshaping:
  - `reshape()`, `flatten()`, `ravel()`, and `transpose()`
- Basic concepts of tensors and multidimensional arrays
- Scalar operations and broadcasting

## Tools Used

- Python (Google Colab environment)
- NumPy
